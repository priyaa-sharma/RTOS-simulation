Here’s a formal and complete version of your `README.md` for the simulated RTOS project:

# Simulated RTOS in C

*A lightweight, educational RTOS simulation using multithreading in C (POSIX `pthread`).*

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates the behavior of a basic Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) using C and POSIX threads. It provides foundational concepts such as task creation, cooperative scheduling, simulated delays, and task switching — ideal for educational or beginner-level embedded systems projects.

## 📂 Directory Structure

├── rtos-sim.exe        # Output binary (after build)
```

## 🚀 Features

* Cooperative multitasking using `pthread`
* Simulated `yield()` for task switching
* Delay functionality to mimic `sleep()` per task
* Expandable task system (`task3`, `task4`, etc.)
* Output display showing active task switching

## 🛠️ Build Instructions

### Prerequisites

* GCC (MinGW-w64 for Windows or GCC for Unix)
* `make` (optional for automation)
* Terminal environment (CMD, Git Bash, Linux shell, etc.)

### To Compile

```bash
make
```

### To Run

```bash
./rtos-sim
```

If you're on Windows and using Git Bash or CLANG64:

```bash
./rtos-sim.exe
```

## 📖 How It Works

Each task is a separate function that performs some repetitive logic.
The scheduler maintains a task queue and performs context-switching using cooperative yielding. Tasks voluntarily yield control, allowing others to execute in a round-robin fashion.

**Example Output:**

```
[Task1] Running...
[Task2] Running...
[Task1] Running...
...
```

## 💡 Future Plans

I'm working on implementing a **Python-based GUI** that will:

* Visually represent task execution timelines
* Simulate CPU cycles and scheduler behavior
* Allow user-controlled delays and manual yielding
* Animate task switching in real-time
